Sentiment Analysis on 1.6 Million Tweets

Overview
This project involves conducting sentiment analysis on a dataset of 1.6 million tweets using Python. The analysis includes extensive data preprocessing and the application of logistic regression for sentiment classification. Various data visualizations, such as sentiment distribution, word clouds, and sentiment analysis by flag, are used to provide insights. Additionally, sentiment trends over time are tracked to understand the evolution of sentiments.

Features:-

1)Visualizations: The project includes several key visualizations to analyze the sentiment data effectively. The sentiment distribution was visualized to show how sentiments are spread across the dataset. Word clouds were created to highlight prominent terms associated with different sentiments, providing a visual representation of the most frequent words. Additionally, sentiment analysis was performed based on various flags, allowing us to examine and visualize sentiment distribution across different categories. Lastly, sentiment trends over time were tracked and visualized to observe how sentiments have evolved throughout the dataset.
2)Preprocessing: Performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis.
3)Sentiment Analysis: Utilized logistic regression for classifying sentiments of tweets.

Dataset:-
The dataset used for this analysis consists of 1.6 million tweets with the following columns:

target: Sentiment label
id: Tweet identifier
date: Date of the tweet
flag: Flag indicating specific conditions or categories
user: Username of the tweet author
